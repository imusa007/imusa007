:book: Who am I?
ðŸ‘‹ Greetings! I'm a computational physicist with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the universe through code.

:Book: What I do?
I develop software for numerical simulation and scientific computing. I use C++ and Python often together to make high-performance code. I have experience in developing software using 
MPI and CUDA. Currently I am combining machine learning with molecular dynamics simulation to make a new generation of advanced material.

:book: What's My Dream
ðŸŒŸ I have a huge interest in the Large Language Model as I believe it has great potential to change scientific research. Imagine every morning you get a summary of exciting new research findings in your inbox. Imagine you do not have to check grammar, spelling mistakes, or how to write a persuasive line to publish an LLM app do that for you, so you can concentrate on science
